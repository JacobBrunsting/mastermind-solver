# mastermind-solver

This is a c program that can solve codes using the rules of the game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). It is very messy, since I hacked it together over a few hours, but it seems to work alright. There are some constants that I plan to optimize by writting a function that will constantly run through the solving algorithm with different codes, while changing the values of the constants, to find the best constant values.
